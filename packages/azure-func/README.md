# Nx Azure Function Plugin

This plugin provides generators and executors for Azure Functions.

## Installation

To install the plugin, run the following command:

```bash
npm install -D @ziacik/azure-func
```

## Usage

Once the plugin is installed, you can use it to generate an azure func application.
This doesn't require to have a `func` cli installed, but to `serve` or `publish` the app, it does.
